# Node Insta Schedule

This is a server side application built to automatically publish Instagram posts on a specific data and time. It uses MongoDB as data storage and supports multiple accounts. This is only the backend part, you‚Äôll still need a frontend to make the necessary REST API request for scheduling a photo though. But you can obviously do this with postman or curl manually.

The account login session is being created and stored in the DB after creating a POST request against the `/add-instagram` route.

To schedule a picture you just have to make another POST request against `/upload-photo` with the image, description and username included.

## Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Warning 
Since this project relies an unofficial Instagram API wrapper there can be occasional problems like sessions getting invalidated or challenges when logging in. Unfortunately Instagram doesn‚Äôt offer a public api to publish photos at the moment. The new publishing api is only available for selected Instagram partners. 

Also theres no dynamic challenge handling built in yet. A challange is an event that Instagram might when a new and suspicious device tries to login to your account.

Accounts that utilize 2FA aren't supported yet either.

## Features
- Email notifications.
- Multi-user support.
- Upload date gets slightly randomized to decrease many uploads at the exact same time.
- Delete scheduled posts.
- List and filter scheduled posts.
- Includes routes for frontend user authentication and handling.
- Exposes the /uploads directory to view uploaded images.
- Included ecosystem file for Pm2 Node processs manager. 

### üì© Email notifications.
Whenever a post failed a mail including photo, description and error report will be sent to the user who scheduled the post. This uses Nodemailer and you'll need to add the credentials to an email account to the config file.

### Multi user support.
You can add multiple users, every user will have its own Instagram account(s). Users can only schedule posts to the accounts added by themselves. They can also only see their own scheduled posts. This features is only interesting if you use this application with a dedicated fronted. Every action is supported by the REST API.

### ‚ùå Delete posts.
You can delete scheduled posts before they're posted.

### üîë Logic for frontend user authentication.
Logic and REST routes for authentication based on [json web token](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) and MongoDB.

## Database Model
ToDo

2. `$ yarn install`
3. `yarn dev`

## üìå ToDo
- [ ] Add challenge handling to register route.
- [ ] Support accounts with 2FA enabled.
- [ ] Add DB model to readme.
